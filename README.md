# Health and Welness iOS Application

This iOS/Swift application was created to fulfill lab 6 and 7 of Oakton's CIS 257 Apps Programming for Apple Mobile Devices, a class I took in the spring of 2021 while working towards a [General Programmer Certificate](https://catalog.oakton.edu/career-programs-pathways/computer-information-systems/general-programmer-certificate/). A description of the course can be found in [the Computer Information Systems course descriptions list](https://catalog.oakton.edu/course-descriptions/course-descriptions-discipline/cis/). In addition, the course syllabus and the instructions for lab 6 and 7 can be found in the course_info folder of the repository.
